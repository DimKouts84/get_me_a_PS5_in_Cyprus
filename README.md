# get_me_a_PS5_in_Cyprus
## Webscrapping stores in Cyprus to search for a PS5 available.


This script checks the biggest retail shops in Cyprus and checks if there is a "Playstation 5 Digital Edition" available for purchase.
If a PS5 is found available, it sends an email (using gmail) with the store name and url to buy it.
